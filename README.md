#
## Exercise 1: Animal Crackers
The code takes a two word string and returns a boolean

If both strings begin with the same letter, you get __True__

And returns __False__ if both words begin with different letters in the strings

#
#
## Exercise 2: Calculator
Here's my first way of writing a code for creating a calculator

This calculator adds only two numbers which was created using user defined functions...

Four operations can be done with this calculator...Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

### --> _Calculator_1_
Here explains how I wrote a code for addition of two numbers using conditionals & the while loop

It also contains a dictionary which links the user's input of the operation, conditionals with the functions

Might look a bit much but my #calculator_100days_2 eliminates some lines of code

### --> _Calculator_100days_2_

Here explains how I wrote my code without using a dictionary but a tuple just to show the user the operations for the calculator

I also used conditionals which shows directly links to the calling of the functions

Some lines of codes from #calculator_100days_1 were erased

Upcoming #calculator_100days_3 will come with a better taste as I improve myself as also courtesy of my #100days of code class with Dr.Angela Yu

Finally....

Enjoy the codes and I'll have to have your comments on how i can improve this mini-project of mine...

## Exercise 3: Conversion-of-Strings-to-Integers-and-Integers-to-Strings

Here's a code for conversion of strings within a particular range to integers and from integers to strings...

Program written with the use of user-defined functions and conditionals...

#
#
## Exercise 4: Lesser of Two Even Numbers

The code checks for the lesser of two given numbers if they're even, but returns the greater if one or both numbers are odd...

#
#
## Exercise 5: Makes Twenty

Here's a code that returns Boolean values if the sum of two integers is 20 or one of them is twenty...

Returns False if the above conditions are not met...
#
#
## Exercise 6: Master -Yoda 

The masteryoda exercise uses a user defined function to reverse any given sentence...

The split and join method helps to carry out the task effectively...
#
#
## Exercise 6: Old-Mcdonald Exercise

This is a code that capitalizes the first & fourth letters of a name...

This was created using a user-defined function & also the capitalize method..
